# Java IV Spring Boot Lab

## Objectives

1. Configure a minimal ``pom.xml`` with the latest Spring Boot parent pom, and
two artifacts: ``spring-boot-starter`` and ``spring-boot-starter-test``
1. Add just enough code to get all tests in both files under ``src/test/java/edu/cscc/java4/sbootlab``
to run successfully

## Getting Started:

1. Copy the starter code from here into a new, private repository in your personal GitHub account using [these instructions](https://github.com/jeff-anderson-cscc/submitting-assignments-lab#copy-the-starter-code-into-a-new-private-repository-in-your-personal-github-account) substituting this repository URL ``https://github.com/jeff-anderson-cscc/java4-labs-spring-boot.git`` for the one referenced in that document
2. Create a new branch for your code changes as described in [these instructions](https://github.com/jeff-anderson-cscc/submitting-assignments-lab#before-you-start-coding)

## Completing the Assignment

__Important:__ you may not change the code in any test cases. _The only permissible difference between the base version of each JUnit test class and yours is yours will have no tests commented out and the file is otherwise identical._

1. Starting with ``edu.cscc.java4.sbootlab.SpringAppTests`` get the first test to pass
2. One by one, get the next test to pass

Once SpringAppTests is completely working, repeat these steps with ``edu.cscc.java4.sbootlab.SpringAppDevProfileTests``
